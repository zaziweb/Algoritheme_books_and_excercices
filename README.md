# Algoritheme_books_and_excercices

There are several books that have made an impression on me:
Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava - The best book for complete beginners in algorithms! I wish this book existed when I started learning algorithms.
Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS - This book is called the "bible textbook of algorithms" by many programmers.
Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne - These authors are instructors of famous Coursera courses about algorithms: Algorithms Part 1 and Algorithms Part 2. Also, this book has an excellent and free site with exercises, presentations, and examples.
The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena - The book describes many advanced topics and algorithms and it focuses on real-life practical examples. This book has one of the best sites with resources (solutions, algorithms, and data structures).
Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani - This book is an official book for algorithms and data structures classes in several famous universities.
Competitive Programming 3 by Steven Halim & Felix Halim - A great book that prepares you for competitive programming (not for complete beginners). You can learn many things and tricks about competitive programming.
Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell - A bit different from the previous books. Prepares you for coding interviews using great coding problems
